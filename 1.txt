"Moving on to the downpipe and front shock tower bar, both were damn near identical matchups. These items required little to no modification to fit, which is awesome because we knew we could make those killer parts from the 10th get straight to work on the 11th. However, after those few parts is where the similarities end." Vincent mentioned that the most surprising aspect of the new model is its engine. Both the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter and 1.5-liter turbo carry over, but when they removed the turbo they found an IHI unit as opposed to the previous MHI version. Both are similar in structure but are produced by different manufacturers.

"The more we dug into the car the more we realized that we didn't get the L15 turbo engine from the previous generation Civic, we got a detuned version of the current L15 turbo engine from the Accord," Vincent said. "The turbo, TIP, cylinder head, etc., is all Accord. The L15BY in the Civic is nothing to go crazy about. Yes, it is a factory turbocharged car, but it's really aimed at the MPG side of things and not the fun performance end." This shouldn't be much of a surprise considering we're not talking about the Si or Type R
