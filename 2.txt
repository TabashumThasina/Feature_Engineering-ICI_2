With just over two months now under their belt with the latest Civic, we wanted to check in and see what they discovered, good or bad, and just how different the new chassis is from the outgoing version. Vincent said, "Out of the box, the car is pretty solid. It's comfortable and drives well, and the inside does feel more luxurious. You can see they really spent some time bringing the level of class up on the inside and it's nice when you get in the driver's seat. I've been daily driving the car for the past 10 weeks so that I can really learn everything about it. We don't just get a car, develop a part, and move on. We learn these cars from bumper-to-bumper, day in and day out so we can truly develop well-crafted and thought-out parts. We did that with our 10th-gens and these new models will be no different."

In those 10 weeks, 27WON wasted no time taking the car apart and diving in. They told us that by day five, they'd already fully removed the turbocharger assembly so they could compare it to the unit found in the previous gen. Vincent explained, "day two with the car and we already had it on the lift and were taking things apart. We wanted to first see how the two generations were different from one another, so we first started by trying to install all of our current 10th-gen parts onto the new car. Intake, turbo, intercooler, etc. We pretty much took it all out to see what would go in."
